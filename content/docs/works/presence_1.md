# Jamaica
In St Elizabeth, I lived amongst country folk who spoke with their hands, their laughter, their pauses. Doors stayed open, music beckoned and stories travelled easily… tucked into everyday conversation. They knew the land by feel, the weather by scent, and people by heart. Living near them taught me that generosity can be quiet, steady, and deeply rooted.

## Delhi
In Delhi, people moved like living currents, quick-eyed and generous with curiosity, each encounter layered with colour, heat, and surprise. Conversations unfolded between horns and tea cups, brief yet vivid, as if the city itself leaned in to listen.

## Rishikesh
Rishikesh slowed everything down. There were no strangers here, everyone offered smiles, silences, and stories .. shaped by the great mother of rivers and the abundant surrounding hills. I met people who spoke softly but carried depth, there was a sacredness in the mundane. Everywhere.
