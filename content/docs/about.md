Photography was my first love.

Growing up in Ireland, surrounded by shifting weather and quiet landscapes, I learned early to pay attention. Nature shaped how I see the world, and photography became a way of listening, a practice of noticing light, rhythm, and stillness. Long before it became a profession, it grounded me.

My life and work have since unfolded internationally. Living and working across different cultures deepened my sensitivity to place, gesture, and the subtle relationships between people and environment. Throughout these journeys, photography remained a constant, a way of staying rooted while moving outward.

Today, I am returning to photography as my primary practice. After a period of illness and change, it has become a mindfulness practice once again, a way to slow down, reconnect with the body, and work with care and intention.

This website marks the beginning of a new research-led phase of my work. Through Stillness in Motion (SIM), I am exploring gesture-based photography informed by contemplative practice, movement, and cross-cultural research, including immersive study in Japan. The work emerging here reflects a deep respect for process, presence, and the natural world.
